        <center> <h1>Heading</h1>
            <p>Lorem ipsum is the filler text that typically demonstrates the font and style of a text in a document or visual demonstration. It serves as a place holder indicating where the text will be in the final iteration. Originally from Latin, Lorem ipsum has no intelligible meaning.</p></center>
       
        <h2>Sub Heading</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site.
            There are six levels of headings.
        </p>

        <!--Unordered Lists -->
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>This is how to make  an ordered list:</p>
        <ul>  
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li> 
            <li>They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>
      <!--Ordered Lists-->
      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" Element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <p>
       <em>Sometimes</em> , you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.
    </p>
    <p>Other time you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phase.</p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
